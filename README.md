SODV2 Shuts down your PC when you take damage.
Just a few quick programs coded a while ago.  
Will probably fix it up a bit and make a release. If not, create an issue and remind me to fix if you want to fool around w/ it.

systemdriverupdater is similar to noescape by enderman. it's a virus. run at your own risk. if you do, make sure that the PNG is in thr C:/ directory.
